# UCSD Algo Trading Project

📈 I'm building a Python-based algorithmic trading backtester and bot, using real stock data to simulate strategies like moving average crossovers, RSI momentum, and more.

🛠️ Built with:
- yfinance
- pandas
- backtrader / vectorbt (in progress)
- matplotlib for plotting

💬 Open to collaborators! DM me or fork and PR!
